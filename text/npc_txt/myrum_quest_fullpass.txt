Myrum approaches you with an eager expression on her face.

"Hey there, I see you have the package!"
"Thank you for going to all of that trouble."

"Remember, this wasn't a favor, it was a job..."
"So here are two Gold pieces for your work.
 
Myrum eagerly opens the package, there are two jewelry boxes inside.

"And this..." Myrum says as she hands you one of the boxes.
"This is for you."
"I bought us each a Tricipian-forged ring!"

"Tricipian technology is quite advanced."
"Anyone who wears a Tricipian-forged ring will be able to bend the laws of probability slightly in their own favor."
"It doesn't work for everything, but it's great for when you need a bit of extra luck."

"Speaking of which, I noticed you've been hanging around Artupio."

Myrum winks.

"He'll never know what hit him."

"Have fun!"
