Ceith responds--
"Relax buddy, it's just that Artupio and I have been excited for a third player."
"We've been stuck with only two-player games the last few days..."
"Most bios don't want to play with us."
"They think us bots have an unfair advantage."
"And they're probably right!"

"Anyway, now that you're here we'll have a wider variety of games we can play."

Artupio chimes in--
"Yeah, I'm ripe for some 'Double Hundo Slam CAM' myself."

"Let us know if you want to play sometime."
"Only two CAMs to get in, and you've got a chance to win six!"
