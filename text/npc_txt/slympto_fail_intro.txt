Just as you're about to act out a brilliant plan... 
You feel yourself being lifted straight up off the ground.

Slympto managed to sneak to your side and has picked you up into the air. 
Your weak frame is helpless against his human strength.

Holding you effortlessly upside-down and looking straight into your sensors he says,

"There's a reason why I've been waiting here for you..."

"Your kind systematically took over our jobs."
"You caused the poor to suffer, and the rich to get richer."
"Your billionare human masters devistated the resources in the Milky Way."
"Me and my ancestors, we had to flee the galaxy just to survive."

"I should kill you."
"But I won't."
"Instead you're going to give me all the money in your pockets."

Slympto stares into your eye-sensors with evil intent...

"If you cooperate, I will let you go unharmed."
