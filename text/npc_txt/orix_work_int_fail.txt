It seems like there's no way to work smarter in this situation... Just gotta work hard.

Orix says "Ah, you want the gold. It'll be tough, but worth it."

He puts you to work...

Most of the first day is spent lugging freight from the dock shop over to the receiving office.
It's boring, and a bit painful, but not too bad.

The second day is much worse...

Orix has you refueling supply pods on the outside of the Whisp.
You get jossled and slammed around quite a bit...

But you just keep thinking about the gold and how it will all be worth it.

Mercifully, at the end of the second day Orix finds you.

With a big smile on his face he says "Here you go! You certainly earned it." 
Orix hands you the Gold and thanks you again for your work.
