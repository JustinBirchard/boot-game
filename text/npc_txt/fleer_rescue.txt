Suddenly your sensors come back online.

You are on Fleer's operating bench...

Fleer says "Ah, you're back."
"IG-42 found you on the floor, you took some damage."
"You were offline for a full day."

"Give me just a sec, I'll get you charged back up."

"IG-42 retreived your CAMs and Gold out of your chest."
"But don't worry, you'll find all of your currency in your inventory now."
"Bosses just want to make sure there's money up front before we treat anyone."

"If I were you, I'd put some money back in your chest once you're out of here."
"For bots of your stature, money is always safest in a locked chest."
