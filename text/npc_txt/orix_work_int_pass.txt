You thought of some ways to make this job a little less dangerous.

Orix says "Ah, you want the gold."
"Extra tough work, but I dont blame you, nothing beats gold."

The first day is spent lugging freight from the dock shop over to the receiving office.
It's boring work, but you stay focused throughout.

The second day is harder...
Orix has you doing some pretty dangerous work.
You get dinged up a bit, but overall it's not too bad.

At the end of the second day Orix finds you.
He looks impressed as he says-

"You definitely earned your wage!"
"I never would have expected someone your size to be able to get so much done in only two days."

Orix hands you the Gold. Then he tosses two CAMs your way and says-

"As long as we've got work, you're welcome to keep on workin!"
