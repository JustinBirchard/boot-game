Fleer notices the package and excitedly exclaims...

"Great! Thank you for grabbing that for me."

He opens the package and places the part near the operating bench.

"And here..."

Fleer hands you 10 CAMs and with a smile on his face says "For your HostBot upgrade fund."

"Alright, let's get Nima booted up!"

With that, Fleer spins around and starts installing the part into Nima's HostBot.
