"First you should get your bearings, explore the Whisp and talk to the people here."

"Your primary objective should be to save up as much money as possible."
"Not only is money necesary for your survival, you will also need it to upgrade to a better HostBot."

"It will cost about 5 Gold or 50 CAMs to buy a better HostBot. So that would be a good amount to save up."

"While you're here, you should also try to learn as much as possible."
"The knowledge you gain will increase your skills and abilities."

"You are welcome to stay with us for as long as you'd like, or you can leave at any time."

"When you are ready to leave go talk to Gleemon in the Holographic Transport Station."
"She will advise you on how to safely beam to the destination of your choice."
