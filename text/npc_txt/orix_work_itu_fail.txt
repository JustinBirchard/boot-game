With that Orix puts you to work. 

Most of the day is spent lugging cargo on and off of ships.

It's tedious and tough. 
You do get dinged up a bit, but it could be worse.

At the end of the day, you wait for Orix by his desk.
Sure enough he shows up and hands you your CAMs.

He pats you on the back and says "Nice work!"
