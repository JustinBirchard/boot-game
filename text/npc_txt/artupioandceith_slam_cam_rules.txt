Artupio looks at you and says--
"Ok, to start with, each of us will put 2 CAMs into the pot."
"That means for each game there are 6 CAMs available to win."

"Each game consists of THREE rounds and TWO tosses."

"In ROUND ONE we make our first toss." 
"We'll all simultaneously throw a 100-sided die onto the table."

"Player scores are determined by the value of the die on their first toss."

"Note that we'll be able to see each other's scores at all times."

"In ROUND TWO we each predict who we think we will win the game."

"There's still another toss before the end of the game, so you'll have to make an educated guess."

"In ROUND THREE we make our second and final toss by throwing another 100-sided die."

"Your final score is determined by the sum of your two tosses."

"At this point the GAME IS OVER and we determine how the CAMs are divided."

"Any player who correctly guessed the winner of the game will receive 1 CAM."
"The player with the highest score is the winner, and will get whatever CAMs remain in the pot."

"After entering the game you have a chance to get anywhere from 0-6 CAMs back in return."

"I should also mention-- "
"If any two players are tied at ANY POINT in the game, then the scores are reset and the game restarts."

"Come back and see us anytime you want to try a game."
"I'll keep playing until my pockets are empty."
