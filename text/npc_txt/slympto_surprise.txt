Upon entering the Charge Station you notice that the overhead lights are off.
The only light source is coming from the small lamp that is plugged in near the doorway.

It's difficult to see clearly...

. . .

Someone else is here!

. . .

It's Slympto. 

You can see his stupid mustache even in the low light.
You have a bad feeling about this.
There's no logical reason for him to be creeping around in here with the lights off.

He hasn't seen you yet but it seems like he heard the door when you opened it.

A jolt of fear sizzles through your circuits...
