You can tell from Slympto's position that he'll have to spin awkwardly in order to face you.
You quickly rush between his legs and hook his foot with your arm.
He spins, trips, and starts falling...

"You worthless piece of junk!" He shouts as he collapses towards the ground.

Anticipating his fall, you twirl to the side and avoid him.

As he begins to get up you run into the Commons and shout "Help! Somebody..." 
Myrum sees you and shouts loudly-- "IG-42, we need you!"

Just as Slympto emerges from the Charge Station IG-42 bursts out of the Digital Hospital at blinding speed...

Two metal cords shoot out of IG-42's arms straight at Slympto. 
They hit their mark and wrap him tightly, causing him to once again collapse to the ground.

"You hear a loud metalic voice chime "SLYMPTO of Earth! Do not resist. You are under arrest."

IG-42 then effortlessly lifts Slympto into its arms and dashes through the Commons and into the Main Hall.
