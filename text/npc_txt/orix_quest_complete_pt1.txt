Orix looks at you with an excitement in his eyes as he says "We're all caught up!"

"It's been great having you around, so I hate to say it..." 
"But I don't think I'll need your services anymore."
"Thank you for everything!"

"You did all five days, so I owe you a bonus."

"I had a few extra DLH-15 HostBots lying around, same model you have."
"I was experimenting with them, and I figured out a pretty easy way to strengthen your frame!"

"Here... I made this set of plates that fit on your chest and your back."
