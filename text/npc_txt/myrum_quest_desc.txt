"No need to do me any favors."
"But I'll hire you for a job."

"Head to the Main Hall, my room is the first door on the east side."
"The code to get in is 982014. Here, I'll write it down for you."

Myrum takes out a pen, scratches down the code on the corner of a napkin, and hands it to you.

"Once you're in, head to the kitchen and open the top cabinet."
"You'll see a jar that's holding some Gold and an Order Form."

"Grab 5 Gold and the Order Form and take them to the Dock Shop."
"There you'll find the Dock Shop Chest."
"Place the Order Form and 5 Gold into the chest."

"Orix works at the Dock Shop, he'll make sure the order goes through."

"After two days have passed, my shipment will arrive and Orix will place my package into the community mail container in the Receiving Office."

"Once it's ready for pickup, if you could please deliver it to me."
"I know I'm asking a lot, but I'll make it worth your while."

"Thanks for your help!"
