Orix exclaims--
"Oh good you're back." 

"I found something that I think you'll find very useful." 
"It's called a Tricpian Voltage Extender."

"It hooks onto your exisiting circuitry and provides two extra power bars!"
"People don't realize how useful Tricipian technology is."

"And it's not very expensive either..."
"I'll sell it to you for 15 CAMs." 

"What do you say?"
