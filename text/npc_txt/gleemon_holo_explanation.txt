"Holographic Transport (Holo Tran) allows us to beam your conscious mind to a neighboring Holo Tran system."

"Our station here is linked to a corresponding hub at the Tricipian Merchant Market."
"Tricipia is a mostly lawless planet, but the Consortium of Agreeable Merchants governs this particular market."

"When your mind arrives, it will be linked to a holographic projection of your physical body."
"The range of the projection is limited to a circumferance of about 500 meters."
 
"This form of travel allows a person to visit with friends, see interesting locations, buy and sell goods, etc."

"The money that you have on your physical body can be used to buy and sell goods even while in holographic form."
"This is because Holo Tran stations have the ability to teleport small items like CAMs and Gold pieces."

"At the end of the day, the merchants simply go retreive their money from the station."
"And any items you buy will be shipped by the merchants and will be waiting for you in the Receiving Office on your return."

Gleemon stops and thinks for a moment, then continues--

"There are a few other things you should know--"

"Your holographic form cannot be harmed, however, in rare cases your mind can be altered or damaged..."
"So you must employ the same caution you would normally use in day-to-day life."

"For example--" 

"The technology will not allow you to walk through walls or defy the laws of physics."
"Similarly, it is advised that you treat people with the same respect you usually would."

"You can beam yourself back at any time by visiting the station and talking with the attendant there."
"Otherwise we will beam you back automatically after four hours."
