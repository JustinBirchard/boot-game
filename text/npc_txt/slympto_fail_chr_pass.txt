While dangling upside down you summon all your confidence and say--

"You know, Fleer is going to wonder why you are holding me like this..."
"We meet everyday in the Charge Station at this time."
"We can both relax right here and wait for him if you'd like."

Slympto stares at you with a look of shock.

"You're lying." He says... but you can tell his confidence is waivering.

"I can't risk it..." He mutters to himself.

He puts you down and then dashes out the room.
