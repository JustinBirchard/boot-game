You're able to come up with a clever plan...

There's a lamp on a desk near the doorway, you grab it and throw it towards Slympto.
In the process, the cord yanks from the wall causing the room to go dark.

"Ah! What?" Slympto exclaims, clearly surprised by the sudden darkness.

It's too dark to see anything, but you can hear that Slympto is stumbling around trying to orient himself.
"I know who you are, you apocolyptic hunk of rust." He whispers.

As Slympto is fumbling around and making idle threats you slip behind him and creep out the door.

Slympto sees the light coming through the door and shouts "Stop!"
But it's too late...

IG-42 is in the Commons, you rush up to it and say "Please, help, Slympto is up to something evil in the Charge Station!"
The droid rushes through the door towards Slympto...

Moments later you hear Slympto shouting "No, everything is fine in here, you dont need to..."
Then you hear IG-42's loud metalic voice say "Slympto of Earth, do not resist, you are under arrest!"
