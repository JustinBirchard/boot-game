Orix has you sit down on his work bench while he welds the plates into position.

After a few minutes he says "There you go!"
He knocks his knuckles on your chest lightly...
"Stronger than ever!"

"You should still upgrade to a better model of Hostbot." 
"But this will at least keep you a bit safer in the meantime."
