You come to the realization that over-thinking the situation won't do you any good. 
You decide to trust your instincts.

Orix puts you on loading duty. 
Lots of ships coming through today, and they need to get in and out fast.

After about an hour, you realize there is a certain rhythm to it all...
You're able to get in the groove and get a lot done.

At the end of the day Orix walks up to you with a look of astonishment.

"This is fantastic! I never expected you would get so much done." 

Orix hands you the 5 CAMs plus a little extra.

"As long as we've got work, you've got a job, thanks again."
