"In theory you could do it..." 
"But I don't want to be liable if you get injured."

"The work involves a variety of tasks--" 

"Loading and unloading cargo from ships that are docked,"
"Carting boxes to the Receiving Office,"
"Unpacking crates and arranging the stock,"
"And refueling ships and support pods--" 
"Which sometimes involves space walks on the Whisp's hull."

"Even for a larger person, the work is dangerous."
"Someone your size is guaranteed to get a bit dinged up."

"But..."

"I am pretty desperate for help right now."

"If you really think you're up for it..." 
"I'll pay you 5 CAMs for a day of work, or 1 Gold for two days of work."

"I've got about five days of work available for whoever wants the shifts."
"If you work all five of them for me I'll throw you a bonus."

"But, as I always tell my employees--"

"This is a 'WORK AT YOUR OWN RISK' situation."
"I can't afford to pay extra for medical or funeral expenses."

"Give it some thought, and come back and see me if you're still interested."
