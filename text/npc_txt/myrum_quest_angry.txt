Myrum approaches you with an expression of contempt.
She glances over towards the security droid, IG-42, who is standing nearby.

"I've got to admit I'm a bit surprised."
"I didn't think you'd have the courage to show up."

"I'll have you know--"
"Not only was I going to pay you handsomely for the job..."
"I was also going to give you a gift. One that was worth far more than the money you stole."

Myrum looks at you with disgust.
"Keep what you stole. I won't press charges this time, but next time you won't be so lucky."

With that she spins around and walks away.
