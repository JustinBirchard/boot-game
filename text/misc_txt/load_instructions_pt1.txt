***Make sure that your original character file is in the root directory of 'boot' game folder***

***Your original character file is a .txt file.***

***The file name will start with your character's name and end with _original.txt***

***EG- If you named your character 'Ralph', then your character file will be 'Ralph_original.txt'***
