"A few final things I am obliged to mention..."

"In accordance with laws outlined by the Consortium of Agreeable Merchants, we have provided you with 5 CAMs."
"You will find them in your personal chest, which is in your room."

"Oh right. You don't know what a CAM is..."

"The Consortium of Agreeable Merchants does not believe in the value of Gold." 
"Therefore they have created their own currency called 'CAMs'."

"1 Gold piece is equivilent to approximately 10 CAMs."
"In order to survive, you'll need both CAMs and Gold."

"Your first objective should be to try to save up as much currency as you can."

"Your second objective should be to head to the Tricpian Merchant Market."
"There you will be able to purchase a new HostBot and other items."

"It would be dangerous for you to physically leave the Whisp with a DLH-15 HostBot, you are too fragile."
"So you'll want to travel there holographically."

"To learn more about holographic travelling, go see Gleemon, she works in the Holographic Transport Station."

"Another thing--"

"Your HostBot runs on a rechargable battery cell."
"Your battery is fully charged right now, but you'll need to keep an eye on your energy level."
"If you run out of power you will likely take damage."
"And it costs 2 CAMs for a recharge and reboot."

Fleer pauses for a moment.
