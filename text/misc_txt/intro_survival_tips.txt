                       GAME TIPS:

                       --> Keep an eye on your Character Sheet to monitor passage of time, battery power, health, active quests, and other important info.

                       --> You will die and the game will be over if:

                               1) Your health goes to zero
                               2) You run out of battery power and have no CAMs in your chest or inventory to pay for it

                       --> The world will change based on the decisions you make and passage of time.
                           If you talk to the same NPC twice, you may find they have new things to say.
                           Similarly, locations and items will change as the game progresses.
                           If you get stuck, try talking to NPCs again or revisiting places you have already explored.
