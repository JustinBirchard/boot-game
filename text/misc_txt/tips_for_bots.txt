You quickly scan through the book, here are some highlights:

----> You will inevitably run out of power and need to be rescued.
      Rescue costs 2 CAMs and causes one game day to pass.

----> Keep an eye on your Character Sheet to monitor your health, battery power, currency, passage of time, and other info.

----> If you need a day to pass, use the Hibernation Port in your room.

----> Take time to examine the rooms you visit.

----> There are two ways to die:
      1) If your health goes to zero
      2) If you run out of battery power and the combination of the CAMs in your chest and inventory is less than 2.

----> The safest place to store money is inside of your chest.

----> Room options and NPC dialouge will change based on decisions you've made and the passage of time.

----If you get stuck, try talking to NPCs again, take an action that causes time to pass,
    or revisit Rooms you have already explored.
