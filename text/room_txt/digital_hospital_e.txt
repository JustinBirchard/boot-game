Things haven't changed much since last time you looked around...

Fleer has cleaned up from the procedures he performed on you.
He appears to be setting up for something else as he hurries around grabbing instruments and referencing notebooks.

He walks over to his desk where a large box sits, he cuts open the box, and inside is another DLH-15 HostBot...
It looks exactly like you.
