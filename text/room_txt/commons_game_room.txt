The Commons is a comfortable room with several couches and coffee tables lining the walls.
It's a central hub of the Whisp as there are seven doors leading to and from the area.

There seem to be people of all types passing through frequently.
Some are in bandages, some are bots with missing parts.
Others are clearly doctors or part of the Whisp crew.

In the center of the room sits a large dining table. 

On the far side of the room there's a card table where two robots are playing some sort of game.
They notice you and wave for you to come over.
