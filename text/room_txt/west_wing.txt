Not a particularly interesting room as it is mainly used as an access point to other places.

All of the doors are locked, so you assume that only the most important crew members are allowed beyond this point.

There are long metalic coils along the ceilings to provide light and a large colorful rug covers most of the floor.
You notice a glint of light near the corner of the rug... something small and metalic must be reflecting the light from above.
