The Robo Lodge is similar to the Micro Lodge except it is made for larger bots.

There are two doors leading to quarters for robotic patients.
One of the doors has a sign on it that says "Ceith" and the other says "Artupio".

In the corner there's a holographic projector. 
Beside it is a glass case with a label that says "Holo-Films".

A few of the titles catch your eye- 
"Godzilla vs the Death Star"
"James Bond: Intergalactic Jellyfish"
"231st season of The Simpsons"

You're tempted to hang out, but decide to head back to the Commons instead.
