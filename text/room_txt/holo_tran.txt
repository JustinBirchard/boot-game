The Holographic Transport room is dimly lit by spiraling coils that form an "X" accross the entirey of the ceiling.

Along each wall are oval chambers that are mostly made of glass.
Through the glass you see that each chamber has a cushioned chair inside.

In the center of the room is a lab station with large braided cords going from the central computer and up into the ceiling.
The computer itself is quite large and has a wide variety of switches, buttons, and knobs.

Next to the computer Gleemon is sitting at her desk.

She has some charts and notes out in front of her and appears to be updating some settings in the computer.
You notice a large mug of steaming pink liquid on her desk.
There's also a single, large, hoop-shaped earring sitting beside the mug.
