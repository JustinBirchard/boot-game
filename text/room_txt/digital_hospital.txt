The Digital Hospital is similar to a hospital for humans except everthing is made for tending to robots and droids.

A spider-like array of small cameras and tools are attached to hydrolic arms that hang down from the ceiling above Fleer's operating bench.
It bears an uncomfortable resemblance to something a maddened, diabolical dentist might own.

Currently, there's an impressive collection of tiny tools splayed out on the bench.
You can only assume they were the tools used to prepare your HostBot and BrainChip.

In the corner of the room sits a large egg-shaped vacuum chamber with several bright colored hoses coming out of the top.
As you are pondering what it could be used for, a puff of steam vents out from the top...

Air begans flooding into the egg-shaped chamber .  .  .  

A verticle door retracts!

Fleer calmly walks over to the egg-shaped chamber as a tall, metalic figure emerges from behind the door.

"You're all set!" Fleer tells the patient.

The patient looks at Fleer and responds with a chiming metalic voice, "It has truly been a pleasure speaking with you today."

"As always!" Fleer chuckles, and then walks back over to his desk.
