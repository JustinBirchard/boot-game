You step in and take a look around the Bio Hospital.

It's a medium sized room with with two hospital beds and a variety of medical equipment.

There aren't any patients being treated currently, but one of the doctors is sitting at a desk studying something on her computer screen.

You don't want to bother the doctor so you head back out to the Commons.
