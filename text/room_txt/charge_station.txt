The Charge Station is well lit by two long, glowing coils that are attached to the ceiling.

There is also a small desk with a lamp near the doorway.
A sign above the desk reads-- "Free charging for all patients and crew."

There are four gigantic batteries in the corners of the room.
Each has a thick, braided cable that connects at the top, and goes up into the ceiling.

Four large power jacks are positioned on every wall, each with different shaped inputs.

Dozens of multi-colored cords hang from the cieling in the center of the room.

Every power jack, cord, and plug is color-coded.
There's a chart on the far wall that explains how each type of robot, droid, and device can be charged.
