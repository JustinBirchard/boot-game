Your room is about the same size as a utility closet, perfect for anyone under three feet tall.

There's a miniature wooden desk and chair in one corner.

Along the far wall is a sign that says "Hibernation Port".
Under the sign sits a comfortable looking leather chair. 
A long retractable cord is coming down from the ceiling and hanging just above the seat of the chair.

Near the entryway sits your chest, it is glowing a faint orange color and appears to be made from some sort of alien metal.
