Myrum's humble apartment has a living area, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a bedroom.

In the living area there's a holographic projector and a couch. 
A bookshelf in the corner is full of large and small books.

In the kitchen there are several cabinets above the sink, and a step-stool beside the fridge.

You notice a push-pin bulletin board next to the fridge, there are a few old photos and some notes. 
From your vantage point you can see that one of the notes says "REMEMBER" in large styled handwriting...
But given that you are only two feet tall, you are not able to make out the rest of the note from here.
