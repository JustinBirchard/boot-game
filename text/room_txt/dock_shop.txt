A short hallway contains two doors, one is labled "The Whisp Receiving Office".
The other says "Holographic Transport".

Beyond the hallway is a spacious docking area. 

There are several work benches throughout the room and an assortment of gnarly looking tools.

A circular portal is built into the ceiling in the center of the room.
A modest but sturdy freight elevator is positioned to go up and down between the floor and the portal.

Apparently freight ships can attach to the portal from outside the Whisp, from there they can transfer supplies to the elevator.

On the far wall, there's a huge door that opens into space.
From here, medical ships and smaller vessels are able to dock inside the Whisp.

For safety, all of the floors inside the room are "painted" with blue lines created from lasers. 
This casts a mild sheen on everything near the designated paths.
You assume the paths can be configured differently depending on the situation.

Strangely, in one corner of the room there's a counter with a sign above that reads "The Dock Shop".
They have an odd assortment of items for sale including parts for ships, medical supplies, and more.

Near the shop is a chest with a sign that says "Whisp Community Shipping Chest".
A note below reads "Please leave item and shipment fee inside the chest and the staff will take care of the rest."
