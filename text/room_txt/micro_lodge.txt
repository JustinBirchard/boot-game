The Micro Lodge feels inviting.

A coffee table sits in front of a very small couch near the entryway.
In one corner there's a book shelf with with a variety of holographic novels.
About half the room is covered by a fancy blue rug.

There are two small doors, each with quaint "Welcome" mats in front.

One of the doors has a tiny sign with your name on it.
The other room seems to be unoccupied.
