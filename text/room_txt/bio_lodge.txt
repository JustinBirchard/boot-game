The Bio Lodge is similar to the other lodges here except that it's setup for biological types.

In the corner is a small kitchen with the normal amenities.
A pot of steaming, dark-purple liquid is bubbling on the stove.

Against the far wall is a Holo-Game console of some kind.

There are two doors leading to temporary apartments.
One has a sign on it that says "Slympto", the other door doesn't have a sign.

You're tempted to stay and try out some of the games, but decide to head back to the Commons for now.
