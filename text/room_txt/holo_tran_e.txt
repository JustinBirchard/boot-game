The Holographic Transport room is dimly lit by spiraling coils that form an "X" accross the entirey of the ceiling.

Along each wall are oval chambers that are mostly made of glass.
One of the chambers has somebody inside, but you don't recognize them.
Whoever it is has an appearance as if they are sleeping-- their eyes are closed.

Gleemon notices you looking at the chamber and says--

"That's one of our patients, Heathro is her name."
"She's at the Merchant Market buying a pet lermling."
"It's been awhile since we had any animals on board, I'm excited."

Gleemon takes a sip from her mug and turns back to face the computer screen.
